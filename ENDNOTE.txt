Abstract: Millions of traumatic brain injuries (TBIs) occur annually. TBIs commonly result from falls, traffic accidents, and sports-related injuries, all of which involve rotational acceleration/deceleration of the brain. During these injuries, the brain endures a multitude of primary insults including compression of brain tissue, damaged vasculature, and diffuse axonal injury. All of these deleterious effects can contribute to secondary brain ischemia, cellular death, and neuroinflammation that progress for weeks, months, and lifetime after injury. While the linear effects of head trauma have been extensively modeled, less is known about how rotational injuries mediate neuronal damage following injury. Here, we developed a new model of repetitive rotational head trauma in rodents and demonstrated acute and prolonged pathological, behavioral, and electrophysiological effects of rotational TBI (rTBI). We identify aberrant Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) activity as a principal mediator of rTBI. We utilized Cdk5-enriched phosphoproteomics to uncover potential downstream mediators of rTBI and show pharmacological inhibition of Cdk5 reduces the cognitive and pathological consequences of injury. These studies contribute meaningfully to our understanding of the mechanisms of rTBI and how they may be effectively treated.

Abstract: Biological networks are often large and complex, making it difficult to accurately identify the most important nodes. Node prioritization algorithms are used to identify the most influential nodes in a biological network by considering their relationships with other nodes. These algorithms can help us understand the functioning of the network and the role of individual nodes. We developed CentralityCosDist, an algorithm that ranks nodes based on a combination of centrality measures and seed nodes. We applied this and four other algorithms to protein-protein interactions and co-expression patterns in Arabidopsis thaliana using pathogen effector targets as seed nodes. The accuracy of the algorithms was evaluated through functional enrichment analysis of the top 10 nodes identified by each algorithm. Most enriched terms were similar across algorithms, except for DIAMOnD. CentralityCosDist identified more plant-pathogen interactions and related functions and pathways compared to the other algorithms.

Abstract: Drought is one of the most serious abiotic stressors in the environment, restricting agricultural production by reducing plant growth, development, and productivity. To investigate such a complex and multifaceted stressor and its effects on plants, a systems biology-based approach is necessitated, entailing the generation of co-expression networks, identification of high-priority transcription factors (TFs), dynamic mathematical modeling, and computational simulations. Here, we studied a high-resolution drought transcriptome of Arabidopsis. We identified distinct temporal transcriptional signatures and demonstrated the involvement of specific biological pathways. Generation of a large-scale co-expression network followed by network centrality analyses identified 117 TFs that possess critical properties of hubs, bottlenecks, and high clustering coefficient nodes. Dynamic transcriptional regulatory modeling of integrated TF targets and transcriptome datasets uncovered major transcriptional events during the course of drought stress. Mathematical transcriptional simulations allowed us to ascertain the activation status of major TFs, as well as the transcriptional intensity and amplitude of their target genes. Finally, we validated our predictions by providing experimental evidence of gene expression under drought stress for a set of four TFs and their major target genes using qRT-PCR. Taken together, we provided a systems-level perspective on the dynamic transcriptional regulation during drought stress in Arabidopsis and uncovered numerous novel TFs that could potentially be used in future genetic crop engineering programs.

Abstract: Network science identifies key players in diverse biological systems including host-pathogen interactions. We demonstrated a scale-free network property for a comprehensive rice protein-protein interactome (RicePPInets) that exhibits nodes with increased centrality indices. While weighted k-shell decomposition was shown efficacious to predict pathogen effector targets in Arabidopsis, we improved its computational code for a broader implementation on large-scale networks including RicePPInets. We determined that nodes residing within the internal layers of RicePPInets are poised to be the most influential, central, and effective information spreaders. To identify central players and modules through network topology analyses, we integrated RicePPInets and co-expression networks representing susceptible and resistant responses to strains of the bacterial pathogens Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae and X. oryzae pv. oryzicola (Xoc) and generated a RIce-Xanthomonas INteractome (RIXIN). This revealed that previously identified candidate targets of pathogen transcription activator-like (TAL) effectors are enriched in nodes with enhanced connectivity, bottlenecks, and information spreaders that are located in the inner layers of the network, and these nodes are involved in several important biological processes. Overall, our integrative multi-omics network-based platform provides a potentially useful approach to prioritizing candidate pathogen effector targets for functional validation, suggesting that this computational framework can be broadly translatable to other complex pathosystems.

Abstract: Investigating the complexity of host-pathogen interactions is challenging. Here, we outline a pipeline to identify important proteins and signaling molecules in human-viral interactomes. Firstly, we curate a comprehensive human interactome. Subsequently, we infer viral targets and transcriptome-specific human interactomes (VTTSHI) for papillomavirus and herpes viruses by integrating viral targets and transcriptome data. Finally, we reveal the common and shared nodes and pathways in viral pathogenesis following network topology and pathway enrichment analyses. For complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to Kumar et al. (2020).

Abstract: Disrupted synaptic plasticity is the hallmark of major depressive disorder (MDD), with accompanying changes at the molecular and cellular levels. Often, the maladaptive molecular changes at the synapse are the result of global transcriptional reprogramming dictated by activity-dependent synaptic modulation. Thus far, no study has directly studied the transcriptome-wide expression changes locally at the synapse in MDD brain. Here, we have examined altered synaptic transcriptomics and their functional relevance in MDD with a focus on the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC). RNA was isolated from total fraction and purified synaptosomes of dlPFC from well-matched 15 non-psychiatric controls and 15 MDD subjects. Transcriptomic changes in synaptic and total fractions were detected by next-generation RNA-sequencing (NGS) and analyzed independently. The ratio of synaptic/total fraction was estimated to evaluate a shift in gene expression ratio in MDD subjects. Bioinformatics and network analyses were used to determine the biological relevance of transcriptomic changes in both total and synaptic fractions based on gene-gene network, gene ontology (GO), and pathway prediction algorithms. A total of 14,005 genes were detected in total fraction. A total of 104 genes were differentially regulated (73 upregulated and 31 downregulated) in MDD group based on 1.3-fold change threshold and p < 0.05 criteria. In synaptosomes, out of 13,236 detectable genes, 234 were upregulated and 60 were downregulated (>1.3-fold, p < 0.05). Several of these altered genes were validated independently by a quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). GO revealed an association with immune system processes and cell death. Moreover, a cluster of genes belonged to the nervous system development, and psychological disorders were discovered using gene-gene network analysis. The ratio of synaptic/total fraction showed a shift in expression of 119 genes in MDD subjects, which were primarily associated with neuroinflammation, interleukin signaling, and cell death. Our results suggest not only large-scale gene expression changes in synaptosomes, but also a shift in the expression of genes from total to synaptic fractions of dlPFC of MDD subjects with their potential role in immunomodulation and cell death. Our findings provide new insights into the understanding of transcriptomic regulation at the synapse and their possible role in MDD pathogenesis.

Abstract: The suddenly enforced COVID-19 pandemic lockdown has impacted the Earth's environment, and several studies have reported a significant change in air pollution using remote sensing data. In this study, we highlight significant changes in the environment due to reduced human activities using MODIS, Sentinel-5 and NASA-USDA/SMAP satellite data. Critical parameters such as nitrogen dioxide, land surface temperature, surface soil moisture and normalized difference vegetation index were compared (pre-pandemic and post-pandemic) for six highly impacted cities around the world. This study is crucial for environmental management to maintain sustainability of the Earth's ecosystem.

Abstract: In the last two decades, advances in network science have facilitated the discovery of important systems' entities in diverse biological networks. This graph-based technique has revealed numerous emergent properties of a system that enable us to understand several complex biological processes including plant immune systems. With the accumulation of multiomics data sets, the comprehensive understanding of plant-pathogen interactions can be achieved through the analyses and efficacious integration of multidimensional qualitative and quantitative relationships among the components of hosts and their microbes. This review highlights comparative network topology analyses in plant-pathogen co-expression networks and interactomes, outlines dynamic network modeling for cell-specific immune regulatory networks, and discusses the new frontiers of single-cell sequencing as well as multiomics data integration that are necessary for unraveling the intricacies of plant immune systems.

Abstract: Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PanNETs) are a heterogeneous population of neoplasms that arise from hormone-secreting islet cells of the pancreas and have increased markedly in incidence over the past four decades. Non-functional PanNETs, which occur more frequently than hormone-secreting tumors, are often not diagnosed until later stages of tumor development and have poorer prognoses. Development of successful therapeutics for PanNETs has been slow, partially due to a lack of diverse animal models for pre-clinical testing. Here, we report development of an inducible, conditional mouse model of PanNETs by using a bi-transgenic system for regulated expression of the aberrant activator of Cdk5, p25, specifically in beta-islet cells. This model produces a heterogeneous population of PanNETs that includes a subgroup of well-differentiated, non-functional tumors. Production of these tumors demonstrates the causative potential of aberrantly active Cdk5 for generation of PanNETs. Further, we show that human PanNETs express Cdk5 pathway components, are dependent on Cdk5 for growth, and share genetic and transcriptional overlap with the INS-p25OE model. The utility of this model is enhanced by the ability to form tumor-derived allografts. This new model of PanNETs will facilitate molecular delineation of Cdk5-dependent PanNETs and the development of new targeted therapeutics.

Abstract: COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) is a respiratory illness caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Although the pathophysiology of this virus is complex and largely unknown, we employed a network-biology-fueled approach and integrated transcriptome data pertaining to lung epithelial cells with human interactome to generate Calu-3-specific human-SARS-CoV-2 interactome (CSI). Topological clustering and pathway enrichment analysis show that SARS-CoV-2 targets central nodes of the host-viral network, which participate in core functional pathways. Network centrality analyses discover 33 high-value SARS-CoV-2 targets, which are possibly involved in viral entry, proliferation, and survival to establish infection and facilitate disease progression. Our probabilistic modeling framework elucidates critical regulatory circuitry and molecular events pertinent to COVID-19, particularly the host-modifying responses and cytokine storm. Overall, our network-centric analyses reveal novel molecular components, uncover structural and functional modules, and provide molecular insights into the pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 that may help foster effective therapeutic design.

Abstract: Disparities in cancer patient responses have prompted widespread searches to identify differences in sensitive vs. nonsensitive populations and form the basis of personalized medicine. This customized approach is dependent upon the development of pathway-specific therapeutics in conjunction with biomarkers that predict patient responses. Here, we show that Cdk5 drives growth in subgroups of patients with multiple types of neuroendocrine neoplasms. Phosphoproteomics and high throughput screening identified phosphorylation sites downstream of Cdk5. These phosphorylation events serve as biomarkers and effectively pinpoint Cdk5-driven tumors. Toward achieving targeted therapy, we demonstrate that mouse models of neuroendocrine cancer are responsive to selective Cdk5 inhibitors and biomimetic nanoparticles are effective vehicles for enhanced tumor targeting and reduction of drug toxicity. Finally, we show that biomarkers of Cdk5-dependent tumors effectively predict response to anti-Cdk5 therapy in patient-derived xenografts. Thus, a phosphoprotein-based diagnostic assay combined with Cdk5-targeted therapy is a rational treatment approach for neuroendocrine malignancies.

Abstract: Systems biology is an inclusive approach to study the static and dynamic emergent properties on a global scale by integrating multiomics datasets to establish qualitative and quantitative associations among multiple biological components. With an abundance of improved high throughput -omics datasets, network-based analyses and machine learning technologies are playing a pivotal role in comprehensive understanding of biological systems. Network topological features reveal most important nodes within a network as well as prioritize significant molecular components for diverse biological networks, including coexpression, protein-protein interaction, and gene regulatory networks. Machine learning techniques provide enormous predictive power through specific feature extraction from biological data. Deep learning, a subtype of machine learning, has plausible future applications because a domain expert for feature extraction is not needed in this algorithm. Inspired by diverse domains of biology, we here review classic systems biology techniques applied in plant immunity thus far. We also discuss additional advanced approaches in both graph theory and machine learning, which may provide new insights for understanding plant-microbe interactions. Finally, we propose a hybrid approach in plant immune systems that harnesses the power of both network biology and machine learning, with a potential to be applicable to both model systems and agronomically important crop plants.

Abstract: Cyanobacteria are one of the ancient bacterial species occupying a variety of habitats with diverse metabolic preferences. RNA regulators like riboswitches play significant role in controlling the gene expression in prokaryotes. The taxonomic distribution of riboswitches suggests that they might be one of the oldest mechanisms of gene control system. In this paper, we analyzed the distribution of different riboswitch families in various cyanobacterial genomes. It was observed that only four riboswitch classes were abundant in cyanobacteria, B(12)-element (Cob)/AdoCbl/AdoCbl-variant riboswitch being the most abundant. The analysis suggests that riboswitch mode of regulation is present in cyanobacterial species irrespective of their habitat types. A large number of unidentified genes regulated by riboswitches listed in this analysis indicate the wide range of targets for these riboswitch families. The analysis revealed a large number of genes regulated by riboswitches which may assist in elaborating the diversity among the cyanobacterial species.

Abstract: Age-dependent senescence is a multifaceted and highly coordinated developmental phase in the life of plants that is manifested with genetic, biochemical and phenotypic continuum. Thus, elucidating the dynamic network modeling and simulation of molecular events, in particular gene regulatory network during the onset of senescence is essential. Here, we constructed a computational pipeline that integrates senescence-related co-expression networks with transcription factor (TF)-promoter relationships and microRNA (miR)-target interactions. Network structural and functional analyses revealed important nodes within each module of these co-expression networks. Subsequently, we inferred significant dynamic transcriptional regulatory models in leaf senescence using time-course gene expression datasets. Dynamic simulations and predictive network perturbation analyses followed by experimental dataset illustrated the kinetic relationships among TFs and their downstream targets. In conclusion, our network science framework discovers cohorts of TFs and their paths with previously unrecognized roles in leaf senescence and provides a comprehensive landscape of dynamic transcriptional circuitry.

Abstract: Online retrieval of the homologous nucleotide sequences through existing alignment techniques is a common practice against the given database of sequences. The salient point of these techniques is their dependence on local alignment techniques and scoring matrices the reliability of which is limited by computational complexity and accuracy. Toward this direction, this work offers a novel way for numerical representation of genes which can further help in dividing the data space into smaller partitions helping formation of a search tree. In this context, this paper introduces a 36-dimensional Periodicity Count Value (PCV) which is representative of a particular nucleotide sequence and created through adaptation from the concept of stochastic model of Kolekar et al. (American Institute of Physics 1298:307-312, 2010. doi: 10.1063/1.3516320 ). The PCV construct uses information on physicochemical properties of nucleotides and their positional distribution pattern within a gene. It is observed that PCV representation of gene reduces computational cost in the calculation of distances between a pair of genes while being consistent with the existing methods. The validity of PCV-based method was further tested through their use in molecular phylogeny constructs in comparison with that using existing sequence alignment methods.

Abstract: Parasitic MAPKs exhibiting significant divergence with humans and playing an imperative role in parasitic metabolic activities have been exploited from several years as important targets for development of novel therapeutics. In addition, the emergence of the drug-resistant variants of parasitic diseases in the recent years has aroused a great need for the development of potent inhibitors against them. In the present study, we selected the metabolically active MAPKs LmxMPK4, PfMAP2 and TbMAPK5 of the three parasitic protozoans Leishmania mexicana, Plasmodium falciparum and Trypanosoma brucei, respectively. The homology modeling technique was used to develop the 3D structures of these proteins, and the same was validated by PROCHECK, ERRAT, ProQ and ProSA web servers to check the reliability. Ten phytoligands were employed for molecular docking studies with these proteins to search for potent phytoligand as a broad spectrum inhibitor. In this regard, two phytoligands (aspidocarpine for LmxMPK4 and TbMAPK5 and cubebin for PfMAP2) were found to be more effective inhibitors, in terms of robust binding energy, strong inhibition constant and better interactions between protein-ligand complexes. Furthermore, predicted ADME and toxicity properties suggested that these identified phytoligands exhibited comparable results to control drugs potentiating them as persuasive therapeutic agents for Leishmania, Trypanosoma and Plasmodium sp.
